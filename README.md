# Movie App

## Various considerations

### API

- The very first thing I had to do is read the documentation of the API I am supposed to be using.
- I had to familiarize myself with the data I am getting from the API.
- This helped me significantly with the further steps in this initial 'pre-code' work. 

### Pages

- The first thing I had to determine is which pages I am going to need for this app.

- The app is relatively small I decided to go with only two pages: main page (root page) and movie page which will show more detail about the selected movie.
